Tired of people being able to dupe items you don't want them to?

This is a remake of the popular dupe plugin DupePlus, this plugin fixes the biggest glitches in DupePlus.

Experience bugs? DM me on discord (pro2021ca)


Commands:
/dupe <amount>: dupes your item
/blacklist <add/list>: add an item to blacklist or view all items in the blacklist (can also be found in config). Will be adding /blacklist remove later, for now change the config while server is offline
/nondupeable: apply custom data to make the item you're holding not dupeable

Supports bundles and Shulkers!!


Details:
this plugin works by checking the itemtype and lore, everything else gets ignored. This is to make sure you can't bypass it as a player. If you have suggestions on other things i should make it check for lmk.
