Tired of people being able to dupe items you don't want them to?

This is a remake of the popular dupe plugin DupePlus, this plugin fixes the biggest glitches in DupePlus.

Experience bugs? DM me on discord (pro2021ca)


Commands:
 /dupe <amount>: dupes your item
 /blacklist <add/list/remove>: add an item to blacklist or view all items in the blacklist (can also be found in config).
 /nondupeable: apply custom data to make the item you're holding not dupeable
 /maxdupe <amount>: set the amount the players can dupe (defaults to 1)

Supports bundles and Shulkers!!


Details:
 this plugin works by checking the itemtype and lore, everything else gets ignored. This is to make sure you can't bypass it as a player. If you have suggestions on other things i should make it check for lmk.

Note:
this is still heavily wip, so a lot of things might be missing. Any ideas, you guessed it, lmk.
