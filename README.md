# DupePlusPlus
The future of duping is here!
> [!NOTE]
> This is a remake of the popular dupe plugin DupePlus<br>

> It is based on an earlier dupe skript I made.

## Commands:
```
 /dupe <amount>: dupes your item
 /blacklist <add/list/remove>: add an item to blacklist or view all items in the blacklist (can also be found in config).
 /nondupeable: apply custom data to make the item you're holding not dupeable
 /maxdupe <amount>: set the amount the players can dupe (defaults to 1)
 ```

## Features:
- Easily blacklist items!
- Able to blacklist items by adding custom data to them!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Details:
> this plugin works by checking the itemtype and lore, everything else gets ignored. This is to make sure you can't bypass it as a player. If you have suggestions on other things i should make it check for lmk.

> [!CAUTION]
> while this plugin is based on a skript I made before that hasn't had any dupes, this is still heavily wip so a lot of things might be missing.
